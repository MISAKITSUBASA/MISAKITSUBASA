## 🧩 What I Care About

I build AI systems that *don’t just predict — they decide, recover, and scale*.

My focus lies at the intersection of:

- **NLP x Infrastructure**:  
  Making foundation models *interactive, grounded, and latency-aware* — not just big, but usable.  
  Think: retrieval pipelines, prompt orchestration, caching layers, and fallback logic that make LLMs feel instant.

- **Learning x Systems**:  
  Designing pipelines that allow ML models to *adapt safely* — with confidence scoring, real-time feedback loops, and metrics tied to user outcomes.

- **Reasoning x Human Context**:  
  Moving beyond pattern-matching. I'm deeply interested in models that simulate **multi-step reasoning**, **personalized interaction**, and **value-aligned behavior**.

## 🚧 What I'm Working Toward

I’m not here to fine-tune one more leaderboard model.

I'm here to engineer:

- 🧠 **Trustworthy NLP systems** that understand, explain, and act in high-stakes environments;  
- 🧩 **Composable LLM agents** that reflect human workflows, not just text completion;  
- ⚙️ **Scalable infra** that makes those systems *resilient, cost-efficient, and measurable*.
